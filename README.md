# Daria Power-Stretch

This is a project I built for my friend Daria Afanasieva as a part of the final project in SkyLab Coders Academy.

The App is a full responsive which displays a list of the workouts  and their details, with an option to book class.

# To run the project (scripts)

After you clone the project go inside each folder  **[frontend, backend]**  and run the command  **npm install**  on both

The scripts you can run with npm (or yarn) are:

-   **npm start**  (to start the server): Start both front & back
-   **npm test**  (to see unit & component tests): In each separated folder [fronend, back-end]
